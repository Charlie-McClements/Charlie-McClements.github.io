                I started by entirely stripping the boat. Removing all cabinetry that was easily removeable in order
                to get the entire saloon as clean as possible (easier said than done). I proceeded to sand down all
                the cabinetry and replacing the pieces that had become too water damaged to be useable after sitting
                in a damp leaking boat for so long. I opted not to paint any of the interior at this stage in the
                interest
                of time, as this would be easy to do once on the water.

                            <p>I installed a new electrics panel as the old one was way past it's use by date....
                                This consisted of a new switch panel as well as the control lcd for the new diesel
                                heater.
                                I made sure I left plenty of room for expansion, keeping in mind that I'd be installing
                                a
                                radio and possibly an MFD at some stage in this area. In order to improve serviceability
                                and
                                upgradeability, I also opted to hinge this panel, making it easy to work on the back of
                                it
                                without the need to break out a toolkit.

                            <p>Due to the short nights of winter, installing lights became a priority in order to enable
                                me to work in the evenings. I used wacom connectors to quickly connect LED lights. The
                                lights
                                I used can be purchased <a

                                These were mounted onto some plywood backing plates and set over the original mounting
                                locations
                                for the original lights in the saloon as well as the aft cabin and the head. Most of the
                                existing
                                wiring for the lights was tin coated and still in good condition. However the wiring to
                                the head did
                                have to be replaced as well as the wiring to the nav desk light.

                Once in the water and I had started to live on the boat during the week, I had plenty of
                time to start painting the interior. I opted to paint the walls and ceiling a light grey
                colour using bathroom paint from B&Q, I've found this to be more than adequate in the past
                and it can provide a considerable saving compared to marine paint. I also decided to paint
                the cabinets a teal colour as I felt like the interior needed a nice splash of colour to
                brighten things up a bit.

                Bonus image at the end to show a very quickly made chopping board that fits snugly over the galley
                sink. Made from an old broken rowing oar. Although I didn't quite have time to get it sanded smooth
                before launching it did serve it's purpose preventing small objects falling down the drain and going
                overboard.
