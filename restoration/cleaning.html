            Cleaning the boat with the pressure washer made a massive difference. However, even an industrial pressure washer
            wasn't strong enough to remove all the grime. After the first round of pressure washing I had to get a scrubbing
            brush and go over the entire boat inch by inch to really remove all the old grime.

            After cleaning many new jobs came up. Several deep chips in the gel coat became apparent resulting in filler having to
            be applied in order to protect the fibreglass from water ingress as well as for cosmetics. In addition to the chips in
            the gel coat, the red stripe along the starboard side of the boat started to flake off. The keen eyed will notice that
            it has already been re-painted in the photos above. This was done using international toplac paint. At first I attempted
            to brush the paint on... I quickly realised this was a bad idea. It was difficult to get the paint spread thin enough to
            prevent it sagging and looking worse than before. Therefore I opted to spray the paint on. This resulted in a much better
            finish however it also resulted in having to quickly scrub off some overspray. Ideally I should have had plastic sheets 
            attached under the tape but didn't have them to hand on the day and wanted to get it finished within my weather window.
