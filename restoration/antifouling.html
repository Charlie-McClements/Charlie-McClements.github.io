                <p>After sitting for several years without touching water, antifouling became a very big job this
                    year. Due to age and not being in the water the existing antifouling was flaking off in places
                    yet stuck fast in others. In order to achieve a good finish that would best prevent growth
                    throughout
                    the year the existing layer had to be striped off the boat.

                        <p>There are several methods that can be used to remove antifoul. One method that was suggested to me was
                            to purchase a chemical which, when applied, acts as an effective paint stripper. Allowing the antifoul
                            to be peeled off easily. Being on the budget that I am on, it became quickly evident that I would not be
                            going down this route.

                        <p>Instead I opted to purchase a heavy duty paint scraper and commit to the arduous task of scraping
                            off all the old antifoul by hand. The scraper I got can be found 
                            <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B06XW819YL/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1" target="_blank">here.</a>
                            This proved to be a very comfortable tool to use due to the short handle making it easy to get into different
                            spots. The spare blades that came with it were essential. I went through three scraping the entire boat (which took
                            >8 hours total)

                Once all the old antifoul had been removed the gel coat was sanded with 80grit sand paper in order to
                key the gelcoat, helping the new paint to adhere properly. After sanding the entire surface was washed
                to remove any dust etc still there after sanding. Then it was time for primer.

                I used temac underwater primer to cover the gel coat. It is important to apply a primer when the gel coat
                is exposed like this as the antifoul paint wont be able to adhere to bare gel coat. In my case temac was all
                that was available locally hence I didn't use the same brand primer as antifoul however this doesn't seem to
                have been an issue. The antifoul I opted for was hempel tigerX in blue. Again, because it was all that was available
                locally. I used a foam roller to apply both the primer and antifoul, I was rather happy with the end results.
